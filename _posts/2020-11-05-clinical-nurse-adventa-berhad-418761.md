		Adventa Bhd is dedicated to the business of medical services and related supplies manufacturing. Since the disposal of its glove manufacturing businesses, the company has strategically focused on medical services to hospitals, institutions, clinical centers and patients directly. The rapidly growing demand for better healthcare has put an enormous burden on governments to increase healthcare spending and at the same time improve quality of care without exponentially increasing costs. Adventa has the experience to manage this demand of better care at affordable cost by working in transparent partnership with healthcare centers to drive down cost lost through scale inefficiency.</div>
<div>
		In offering Supplier Diversity and new products opportunities, Adventa can assist healthcare centers in better control of cost and cashflow</div>
	
	Adventa was awarded through its subsidiary, the EPP status by PEMANDU, the Economic Transformation Unit of the Prime Minister's Department for its pioneering home Dialysis treatment using a sophisticated peritoneal dialysis equipment licenced from Lucenxia AG, Switzerland. This home dialysis business is expected to be launched soon.</div></div></span></div></div></div>
