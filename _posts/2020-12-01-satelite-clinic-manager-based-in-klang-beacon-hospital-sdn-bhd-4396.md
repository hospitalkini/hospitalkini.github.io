<div>
<div>In Malaysia, at the forefront of this exciting revolution and advances in the detection and treatment of cancer is Beacon Hospital. From our humble beginnings in 2005, Beacon Hospital has over the years evolved to become a Cancer Specialist Hospital with a singular vision to combat cancers with advanced therapies and facilities.</div>
<div>Beacon has in fact been one of the pioneer in the field of Cancer management in two senses: one, in being completely focused on this healthcare discipline, and two, being the installed site of the <strong>Halcyon in Malaysia.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Beacon is a medium-sized boutique hospital equipped with 100 beds and a comprehensive team managed by fully, proficient and experienced healthcare professionals with more than 15 years of experience individually. This plays a critical role in ensuring the quality of treatment delivered often exceeding industry standards.</div>
<div>As living and medical costs continue to escalate in Malaysia, Beacon Hospital believes that medical care and treatment should not burden citizens, especially those of us who are unwell and unable to seek the best in medical care. Therefore, at Beacon Hospital, we take every measure to keep the cost of medical care reasonable to allow more people to seek good diagnosis and treatment.</div>
<div>Furthermore, our success in the establishing and managing our first Cancer Excellence Centre, has inspired us to develop seven other specialty centres, namely the Brain and Spine, Bone and Joint, Eye, Men&#8217;s Health and Urology, Women&#8217;s Health, Health Screening and Research centres. These specialty centres are anchored by several medical specialists who have more than 20 years of individual experience, with many recognised as thought leaders in their own right, both nationally and internationally.</div>
<div>
<div>At Beacon Hospital, we strongly believe in driving advancement in both medical treatment and technologies so that we can always remain a step ahead in the battle against cancer and other life-threatening diseases. We have taken the lead in this regard by conducting and participating in active research and in clinical trials.</div>
<div>Beacon Hospital has come a long way from our small beginnings but today, we continue to remain true to our vision of committing to providing our best healthcare for everyone in the country and region.</div>
