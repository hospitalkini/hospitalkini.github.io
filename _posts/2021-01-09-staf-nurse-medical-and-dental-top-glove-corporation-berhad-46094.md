<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<div>
		The Top Glove success story began 28 years ago in 1991.</div>
<div>
		Once a local business enterprise with a single factory and 3 production lines, it has since flourished into the world&#8217;s largest rubber glove manufacturer, owning and operating&#160;42 factories,&#160;682 production lines and with a capacity of approximately&#160;63.9 billion gloves per annum.</div>
<div>
		Its outstanding achievements and global recognition are credited largely to its founder Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai, whose visionary stewardship has taken the company from strength to strength.</div>
<div>
		Further continuing its growth trajectory, it was listed on the Malaysian Bourse in March 2001 and has demonstrated steady growth with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% for revenue and 29% for profit after tax over the past 15 years. It is also a component stock of the FTSE Bursa Malaysia ("FBM") Mid 70 Index, FBM Top 100 Index, FBM Emas Index, FBM Emas Syariah Index, FTSE Bursa Malaysia Hijrah Shariah Index and FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index with a market capitalisation of RM6.7billion as at 16 March 2016.</div>
<div>
		As at 29 February 2016, it had a shareholder fund of RM1.77 billion with a turnover of about RM1.5 billion.</div>
<div>
		Renown for producing high quality gloves at an efficient low cost based on its time-proven Business Direction, Top Glove offers a wide and diverse product range, fulfilling demand in both the healthcare and non-healthcare segment. It serves a network over 2,000 satisfied customers across more than 195 countries, and this number continues to grow.</div>
<div>
		With its eye on the next level of success, Top Glove now aspires to increase its global market share from 25% to 30% by 2020. It is also aggressively expanding its business scope and on the lookout for M&amp;A opportunities in similar and related industries.</div>
