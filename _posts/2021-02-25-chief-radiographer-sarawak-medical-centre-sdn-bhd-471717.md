<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><p>Normah Medical Specialist Centre (NMSC) is a healthcare centre in Borneo. The Company is registered under Sarawak Medical Centre Sdn Bhd (119669-X). It is wholly owned by SFS Inc. an incorporated body under the Sarawak State Government. It was established in 1988 as a 130-bed acute medical and surgical, not-for-profit medical facility, aimed at reducing the large gap in the standards of healthcare found then in Sarawak vis-&#224;-vis those in developed countries. Served by a dedicated team of UK and American board certified physicians and well-trained nurses, NMSC is today highly regarded and trusted for its personalized care, quality standards and treatment outcomes. Since 1997, NMSC has continuously received consultative assistance from the renowned Mayo Clinic, USA to strengthen its ability to provide reliable, evidence-based medicine. Many patients find NMSC&#8217;s doctor-led governance and team-approach to healthcare highly reassuring, knowing that their doctors do not work alone but within a system, thereby ensuring that their best interests as a patient always come first. In 2005, the Malaysian Society for Quality in Health accredited NMSC with full certification, making it the private hospital in Borneo to be so honored. NMSC has now embarked on the journey to further improve all facets of its comprehensive range of services along the Joint Commissioning International standards. This means that patients seeking treatment in NMSC will receive the same level of care and treatment protocols as their counter parts in the developed countries.&#160;</p></div></span></div></div></div>
