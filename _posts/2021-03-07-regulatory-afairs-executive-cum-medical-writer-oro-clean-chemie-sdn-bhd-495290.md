<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<div>
<strong>Over 45 Years Experience of Researching and Producing Disinfectants</strong></div>
<div>
		OCC Switzerland is a research-driven manufacturer of high-quality disinfecting and cleaning products. Our slogan &#8216;killing germs for a safer world&#8217; describes our long-standing mission to support healthcare professionals such as infection control preventionist, doctors, nurses, dentists, veterinarians, beauticians<br>
		and other professionals in their continuous battle to prevent the spread of disease. We do so by offering fast-acting, reliable and safe disinfectants.</div>
	
	Since OCC Switzerland&#8217;s foundation in 1969, the company has pioneered many breakthroughs in the field of infection control. In 1986, we were the first Swiss company who developed a fast-acting, safe instrument disinfectant which was effective against the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). In 1991, concerned about the high risks of disease transmission associated with the use of turbines, hand-pieces, and contra-angles, OCC Switzerland in collaboration with Dr. Guggenheim, a professor from the University of Zurich, developed a disinfectant to be used in a cutting edge device designed to clean and disinfect this type of instruments. And once again, in 1996, we became the first Swiss dental company to be certified EN 46001 and 93/42/EEC.
	<div>
		More recently, we have developed a new generation of surface disinfectants reducing the alcohol content to less than 50 %. We have done so without compromising the disinfectant&#8217;s effectiveness. This new generation of products offers not only full virucidal activity and optimal material compatibility but also significantly reduces the potential for allergic reactions.</div>
<div>
		Since our early days, our goal has been to manufacture innovative, environmentally sensitive products with a broad spectrum effect and high material compatibility maximizing protection against disease transmission. This philosophy has remained unchanged. However, our product range and services have evolved in response to market and consumer demands. Subsequently, the effectiveness of our disinfectants is continually adapted in order to inactivate emerging pathogenic microorganisms.</div>
<div>
		We are proud of our past and present achievements; however, what really excites us is the future. We are pursuing the research and development of new products and devices expanding the base of effectiveness, reducing exposure times and increasing compliance with infection control procedures. Our goal is to work toward the day where diseases no longer pose a threat and health care related infections are non-existent.&#160;</div>
