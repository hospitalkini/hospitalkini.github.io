<strong>About Us</strong></div>
<div>
			Celebrating life&#8217;s precious moments since 1885.</div>
<div>
			In 1885, a young pewtersmith named Yong Koon arrived in Malaya from the Chinese port of Shantou, armed with little more than a set of tools and a determination to succeed.&#160;<br>
<br>
			Today, Yong Koon's humble enterprise is Royal Selangor, the world's foremost name in quality pewter.&#160;<br>
<br>
<strong>Pushing the Boundaries</strong><br>
			Our designers and artisans continuously expand the limits of pewter design while staying true to our heritage of craftsmanship. Joining us on this journey are like-minded design collaborators such as the award-winning Erik Magnussen and Jamy Yang as well as cultural organisations such as the V&amp;A (Victoria and Albert Museum).&#160;<br>
<br>
<strong>Symbols of Sporting Achievements</strong><br>
			Bespoke trophies from Royal Selangor commemorate victorious moments at sporting events such as the Formula 1 in Malaysia, Singapore and China, Shanghai ATP 1000 Masters and the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia Golf Tournament.&#160;<br>
<br>
<strong>Global Presence</strong><br>
			Headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Royal Selangor has standalone stores in top retail capitals around the world, including London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Melbourne and Sydney. Royal Selangor products are also carried by top department stores such as Wako in Japan, Harrods in London, and Hudson Bay in Toronto.<br>
<br>
<strong>Diverse Expertise</strong><br>
			Royal Selangor&#8217;s repertoire of skills in the decorative arts is represented through our sister companies. Famed for fine silverware, Comyns is also renowned for its interpretive works, particularly those of Paul de Lamerie &#8211; one of the leading silversmiths of 18th century England. Selberan specialises in creating 18k gold and diamond jewellery that follows the European approach to craftsmanship.</div>
