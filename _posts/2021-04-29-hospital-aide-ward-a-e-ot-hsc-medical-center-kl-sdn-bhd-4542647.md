		Formerly known as HSC Medical Center, ALTY Orthopaedic Hospital was recently rebranded to reflect the growth and transformation of our hospital, a joint effort between TE Asia Healthcare and our founding group of established Orthopaedic Surgeons, as we pursue our dream of making this the orthopaedic hospital of choice.</div>

Building upon this, ALTY or &#8220;Adding Life to Years&#8221; will now provide focused care for Orthopaedic and Musculoskeletal conditions supported by other medical specialties. Health screening will continue to be a key service of ALTY, branded as HSC Health Screening.</div>
