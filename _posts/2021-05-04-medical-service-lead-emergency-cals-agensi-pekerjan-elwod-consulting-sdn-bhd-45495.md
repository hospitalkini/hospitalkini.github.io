<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<strong>Ellwood Consulting&#160;| The Search and Selection Specialists</strong></div>
<div>
	A specialised recruitment consultancy focusing on mid-senior level placements in the functional areas of finance, financial services, human resources, IT and Sales &amp; Marketing.</div>
<div>
<div>
		There is a gap in the recruitment industry, on one end of the spectrum there are the large, public-listed companies who have a responsibility to their shareholders and are forced to focus on the numbers. On the other end are the venture capital funded firms that have obligations to their investors, and need to focus on delivering quick returns.</div>
<div>
		We fill this gap by bringing&#160;our clients and candidates&#160;the experience and knowledge of the large companies, without the corporate, shareholder focused objectives. At the same time, retaining the aspiration of long-term, mutually beneficial relationships that the smaller venture capital, short-term growth focused firms aren&#8217;t able to sustain.</div>
<div>
<div>
			At Ellwood Consulting we know that, today more than ever, a good hire is about personality and cultural fit rather than just paper qualifications. Our consultants have spent years understanding and identifying the qualities that make great candidates, so that we can make the best recommendations for our clients.</div>
<div>
			We are firm on our promise of building long-term relationships through sector expertise, personal service and an expert approach to continually deliver the best candidates.</div>
<div>
<div>
				Our team of consultants have backgrounds rich not only in&#160;recruitment experience, but in the functions they specialise in. Functional experience means our consultants understand the specific needs of a role and are better able to assess a candidate&#8217;s capabilities and competency.</div>
<div>
				In terms of filling a role, our consultants have wide-reaching networks from which they can source the best candidates. From their previous roles in specialised functions, they know what the right person looks like on paper, and are then able to use their expertise in assessing the soft side of a candidate to narrow down the search and find&#160;our clients&#160;the right candidate.</div>
